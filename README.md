## 🧩 0. Method Overview

BraiNav is a **two-phase Brain-Machine Integration Navigation framework** designed to enhance robustness of embodied navigation agents against visual corruptions by leveraging **human brain activity**.

### 1️⃣ Brain Encoder Pretraining
- A **brain encoder** is first trained on a large-scale human brain activity dataset using a **self-supervised pretrained model**.
- After pretraining, the brain encoder is **frozen** to extract high-level neural representations for downstream navigation tasks.

### 2️⃣ Multimodal Brain-Visual Fusion
- Neural representations from the frozen brain encoder capture **high-level cognitive information**.  
- A **cross-attention based multimodal fusion module** combines visual features from the navigation environment with brain-derived representations to form a **joint brain-visual embedding**.

### 3️⃣ Navigation Policy Learning
- The fused brain-visual embeddings are used to **train a navigation policy**, improving robustness against various visual corruptions.
- Extensive experiments show that BraiNav outperforms standard navigation agents and other vision-enhanced baselines in terms of **SR and SPL**.
